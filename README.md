A [Flask tutorial project](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/), flaskr, for learning [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), a web framework for [Python](https://www.python.org).

Most of the project is learning about [Terminal, Homebrew, Bash 3 vs Bash 4](http://hypepat.com/2016/two-shells-one-prompt.html), Package Managers, Dotfiles, git, GitHub and integrating it with git, and finally Flask for Python. I've added some dotfiles and setup configs to the `.gitignore` that are available upon request for fellow beginners.
